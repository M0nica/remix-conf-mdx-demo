# About

Markdown has become an essential tool for creating content on the web. It is a simple and easy-to-use markup language that allows users to format text using plain text syntax. However, as the complexity of the content increases, Markdown can become limiting. That's where MDX comes in.This demo site showcases the power of MDX in making Markdown more accessible! This site was created by [Monica Powell](https://aboutmonica.com) for [Remix Conf](https://remix.run/conf) and is an MDX-based fork of the [remix-docs](https://github.com/freekrai/remix-docs) stack (which uses Markdoc).
