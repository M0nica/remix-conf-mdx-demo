# Welcome

Welcome to our demo site showcasing the power of MDX in making Markdown more accessible! This site was created by [Monica Powell](https://aboutmonica.com) for [Remix Conf](https://remix.run/conf) and is an MDX-based fork of the [remix-docs](https://github.com/freekrai/remix-docs) stack (which uses [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/)).
