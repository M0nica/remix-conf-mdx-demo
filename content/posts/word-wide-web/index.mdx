## The World Wide Web
<FootnoteRef description='"World Wide Web." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, 23 Apr. 2022, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web."'>The World Wide Web</FootnoteRef>, commonly known as the web, is an integral part of modern life.
  It is a global network of information and resources accessible through the Internet. The web was invented in 1989 by British computer scientist <FootnoteRef description='Berners-Lee, Tim. "Information Management: A Proposal." CERN, 12 Mar. 1989, info.cern.ch/Proposal.html.'>Tim Berners-Lee</FootnoteRef>, who was working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) at the time.

The web consists of billions of <FootnoteRef description={<>"Hyperlink." Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, 8 Apr. 2022, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink</a>.</>}>interconnected web pages</FootnoteRef>, documents, and other resources that are stored on servers all over the world. These resources are linked together through hyperlinks, which allow users to navigate from one web page to another by clicking on a link.

One of the key features of the web is its open architecture, which allows anyone to create and publish content on the web. This has led to an <FootnoteRef description={<>Anderson, Paul. "The Web Is Dead. Long Live the Internet." Wired, Conde Nast, 17 Aug. 2010, <a href="www.wired.com/2010/08/ff-webrip/">www.wired.com/2010/08/ff-webrip/</a>.</>}>explosion of creativity and innovation</FootnoteRef>, with millions of websites covering everything from news and entertainment to business and education.

The web has also revolutionized the way we communicate and connect with each other. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have become a central part of modern life, allowing us to stay connected with friends and family, share our experiences, and discover new things.

However, the web is not without its challenges. The sheer volume of information available on the web can be overwhelming, and it can be difficult to know which sources to trust. In addition, <FootnoteRef description='Greenwald, Glenn. "Why Privacy Matters." TED, 4 Oct. 2014, www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters.'>concerns about privacy</FootnoteRef> and security have grown in recent years, as cyber attacks and data breaches have become increasingly common^6.

Despite these challenges, the web remains an essential part of modern life. Its ability to connect people and resources from all over the world has revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate. As we look to the future, it is clear that the web will continue to evolve and shape our world in new and exciting ways.
